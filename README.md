Artist Statement:

Camp Peddle-ton is an interactive top-down game made with Bitsy that discusses the real-life story of U.S. Marines from Camp Pendleton that smuggled in Mexican immigrants and even drugs during the spring and summer of 2019. 

This game explores the ethicality of immigration laws and the consequences of abusing power/influence by playing from one of the Marinesâ€™ perspectives as he decides to take the side job in the guise of serving their country. 

The immigrants the player picks up will say a random sentence from a shuffled list to give each immigrant a unique reason for immigrating into the United States, making the act of smuggling them in more personal to the Marine and player.

The player will need to pick up all immigrants in the area in one run, tracked by a variable that will allow the player to exit once the immigrants are picked up.

Throughout the game, the Marine is reminded of their duty and loyalty to the United States to contrast with the act of smuggling in the drugs and immigrants their military is seeking to keep out. 

This game ultimately hopes to bring awareness to immigration, trafficking and the possibility of corruption in our trusted institutions.
